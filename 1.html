i love you words i never say
friends make fun but i tell you everyday
anyway lately youve been getting me home safely
wake up love the coffee that you make me
ask me how my night was
i like us
its so easy and we dont ever fight cus
you dont blow up my phone
when youre home alone assuming
that Im coin what a guy does
trust with just the right amount of lust
even loved by my family thats a must
and fun everything we do me and you
my song comes on n u dance n sing too
with the windows down like Gs
we dont care whose around or who sees
and everyone is jealous of my ride
because youre sitting in the passengers side
</p>
<p>
Its the simple things you do
i just cant get enough of you
its that perfume that you wear
and the way you do your hair
that i love so much
its the simple things you say
and how in bed we play
its the way you kiss my cheek
when you think that Im asleep
i love it so much
</p>
<p>
Everyday scrubbing it lovin it
crusin freeways in our PJs c
cause thats the fun of it unless
you wear that pretty black dress o yes
catch me in a suit so i can look as good as you
but i dont owell
with that smile that you wear so well
and the way that you cry in movies
pass you the ball and pass it back to me
beers with the guys
aint no thing
its your eyes and the simple things
that make this work like it should
when you rock my shirt
o you look so good
so take my hand n stay as long as you can w the man
that tells all the jokes only you understand
and i promise to be honest if you promise to accomplish love
all we need is love
