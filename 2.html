<p>Actually there was nothing really neat about today however I really feel like I met the professor that can stimulate students to study hard. It’s quite obvious that getting good grades in a class would be the goal of a college student. In order to get good grades in your class I realized that hard work, sincerity, and diligence would be the key. So as long as I am obligated to listen and as long as I applied willfully, I will have to work hard to achieve my goal in this class.
Frankly, I never saw a professor that would give out homework on the first day of the class, although my knowledge and experience about college is merely just the tip of the iceberg. But hey~, teaching styles are all different and students can’t complain about the way professor’s teach. I was pretty surprised, but though to myself I thought ‘If I am going to attend this class, I better do it good and make the best of it.’

  I will always remember
  The day you kissed my lips
  Light as a feather
  And it went just like this
  No, it's never been better
  Than the summer of<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il-an3K9pjg"

  We were only eleven
  But acting like grownups
  Like we are in the present
  Drinking from plastic cups
  Singing love is forever and ever
  Well, I guess that was true
  Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
  On an old Mustang, where we sang
  Songs with all our childhoods friends
  And it went like this, say
  Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
  Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
  Better hit me, baby, one more time
  Paint a picture for you and me
  Of the days when we were young
  Singing at the top of both our lungs
